Final year project application repository - Gamified application for teaching people how to program

This application was developed for my final year project at Southampton Solent University. The application itself provides a framework
for compiling and executing Java code at runtime. It's primary use was to create various games in which the user can enter Java code to
complete different tasks or levels. Due to having a relatively short development allocation the code may not be optimised.
